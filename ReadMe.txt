JavaScript ES6 has introduced the const keyword to work with constants. const denotes that the reference to value is constant and cannot be changed.
Constants are block-scoped. Hence the variable defined inside a block represents a different value than the one outside.
Also, the constant should be initialized. You cannot just declare a constant. For example,
const x;
// SyntaxError: const declared variable 'x' must have an initializer.
